A cool chess game that I have made.
If u want to check it out follow these steps:
1. create a new folder
2. download the files inculuded in this repository.
3. create a new folder called "assests", and insert all of the images to this folder.
4. start the server.py file.
5. start the main.py twice, so u can play it.
Enjoy
